          <p> I can be just as antisocial as the next introvert, in fact, I often am, but in the last few years I‚Äôve learned just how important it is to seek out meaningful connections. This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll stop being an introvert, it just means that you‚Äôve found people who appreciate you for being, well, you‚Ä¶ because whatever the relationship, social, personal, workplace, everyone brings something to the table and contributes in their own way ‚Äì especially in the professional realm.

          </p>
          <p>
            Networking and meeting people is part of human nature. It‚Äôs what keeps us moving (and what keeps us sane), and while it may be difficult to form such relationships, once you find them, you‚Äôll see that they allow you to explore depths way outside of your comfort zone. 

          </p>
          <p>During my first few months at Viola, it took time for me to adjust. I had just graduated from university and COVID-19 was still lingering. It would probably be easy to blame the pandemic for my being nervous about properly socialising again, but no - that‚Äôs just the way I was. However, eventually I started meeting great people at work and these new connections made me feel much more comfortable in my own space and helped me build my confidence in a completely new setting.  

          </p>
          <p>
            If you don‚Äôt already know, agency life can be absolute chaos. It‚Äôs fast-paced, stressful and difficult to navigate ‚Äì which is exactly why networking is so important, communication is crucial, and maintaining relationships is vital, which, by the way, is a seriously underrated skill. Whether it‚Äôs with coworkers or clients, connections with people with different skills, from different backgrounds and with a variety of interests and opinions are vital for personal growth, and if done properly, will take you far. 

          </p>
          <p>
            These connections may form naturally, but most times a little effort is needed to build on them. In a hectic deadline-obsessed environment like ours, the connections you have made will be the people who have your back and who will support you through both the highs and lows of the agency life. And vice versa!

          </p>
          <p>
            That‚Äôs what connections are all about: creating a comfortable space where people are encouraged to share their thoughts and ideas. A space where collaboration and the exchange of new perspectives is celebrated - and it‚Äôs about belonging to  a culture where people aren‚Äôt afraid of being the best versions of themselves. 

          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, people are complicated, but they don‚Äôt have to be. Here are few ways how you can kick-start connections:

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Active Listening:
            </strong>
            This is an underrated skill. Instead of listening to respond, or nod, listen to find out more about your coworkers! It really helps to know about the people you are with from 9-5 (or 6, or whatever‚Ä¶). Actually listen to each other‚Äôs ideas because exchanging thoughts could possibly lead to you, and/or your colleagues cracking that tough cookie of a strategy! 

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Lend a Helping Hand:
            </strong>
            As I mentioned before, agency life can be chaotic. No one wants to ‚Äì or even needs to - struggle through a tough project on their own, so being able to offer support and help during difficult times is a simple way of showing your colleagues that you‚Äôre there to lend a hand if required. A shared experience can also lead to more meaningful connections, even if it‚Äôs just helping out with a minor task. 

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Be Inclusive
              We‚Äôre all different people who come from diverse backgrounds. But because of this, we bring our authentic selves to the table. We welcome people who are different as their ideas can offer valuable insight that can have a positive impact on your work.

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            While meaningful connections may take a lot of work, they‚Äôre definitely worth it! Networking can take you a long way, emotionally and career-wise, it leads you to feel motivated, and results in a surprising number of different opportunities that encourage even the most introverted of us to grow. And maybe, if you‚Äôre super lucky, you‚Äôll find friendships that last a lifetime!
