                            <li class="mr-3"><a href=""><img src="img/fbPure.svg" /></a>
                            </li>

                    </div>
                    <p>Content is a strange word – I looked it up in the dictionary: happy, calm,
                        tranquil, peaceful, and satisfying – then I realized I was on the wrong
                        page. I Googled™ “Head of Content” and that was also a mistake, because
                        there were about 7,600,000,000 results. So, I needed to work out the who/what/where/when
                        and why of it in order to get things straight in my mind.</p>
                    <p>The role of the Head of Content revolves mostly around maintaining oversight
                        of the activities of all text content produced by an agency - working closely
                        with all the teams in the creation of excellent day to day experiences
                        for our clients – and, of course, for ourselves.</p>
                    <p>It’s not just about skill-sets in a specific language – which is a huge
                        subject in itself in this jargon-laden world - in this line of business
                        we also have to be totally in tune with today’s technology, tomorrow’s
                        technological advancements, and current affairs, and ensure that everyone
                        involved in any kind of content delivery is up to date for the production
                        of relevant and relatable content according to the clients’ brief.</p>
                    <p>Content creation is all about the development and optimization of words,
                        phrases, sentences, structure and nuance, and wrapping it up in cultural
                        awareness, ensuring that narratives and messages directly support the strategies
                        and editorial decisions that have been formulated by the guys on the client-interfacing
                        front line. It’s all about having a grasp on the development and management
                        of the business’s brand standards, tone, style and expression of the business’s
                        corporate identity.</p>
                    <p>We lead and inspire the development of first-class content along with
                        other production elements in order to ensure the optimal delivery of content
                        to target audiences across multiple channels, integrated and aligned to
                        support business objectives.</p>
                    <p>But above all, this is all about team-work. Client services personnel
                        are the gate-keepers who have to understand client briefs and be able to
                        translate them properly and precisely to the content creators. Content
                        creators are the material people who contribute genuine value to an account
                        on behalf of the client. They must be able to read between the lines and
                        ask the right questions about the interpretations of those briefs and the
                        thinking behind them (tone, style, language, structure and vocabulary).
                        They must know the difference between lightweight fluff, jargon, technical
                        lingo and overly verbose factual content – and find the thin line, or sine
                        wave, that traverses them, to be linguistically adventurous by smoothing
                        out the bumps in the content and soothing away the fears of clients who
                        may be locked into a style and tone of declining relevance in today’s connected
                        world.</p>
                    <p>This kind of collective cognisance (analysis of needs, synonyms, antonyms,
                        idiomatic expressions, awareness, perception, notice, knowledge, thought,
                        and consciousness) can only be achieved by mutual cooperation: regular
                        brain-storming, collaboration and communication, from day one; developing
                        faith in your colleagues while earning the trust of your clients.</p>
                    <p>To some people, this is just a matter of words and their usage, but to
                        others, words are just the beginning of a great linguistic journey, and
                        how they are used decides the destiny of its readers.</p>
                    <p>"Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not
                        thunder." -Rumi</p>
