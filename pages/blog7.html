          <p>I’d like to believe that human writers will always have a place in content creation. But how does the new
            Open AI, and its numerous derivatives, really fit into writing, whether creative, artistic, or a social
            media entry somewhere on the web that maybe only a handful of people follow or read?

          </p>
          <p>In recent months, the world’s social media accounts have been set ablaze by ‘influencers’ promoting
            so-called AI sites (here are 5 websites I bet you didn’t know about etc.) offering to produce your press
            releases, thesis, or film script, turn the text into speech, put the words into the mouths of digital
            avatars, add copyright-free music, green-screen your avatar onto a royalty-free video background, and then
            automatically upload it to YouTube so you can make money from a side-hustle…
          </p>
          <p>
            Honestly, I am a little worried.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, in an effort to understand how it may affect me, I visited some of the recommended sites. After
            disregarding those that required registration or (expensive) subscription, and deleting ones that produced
            obviously sub-standard content, I learned that at the moment, all these features can only be achieved by
            visiting a chain of up to 6 sites and progressing one step at a time, at which point many users will give
            up, due to an inherent lack of patience and the demonstrably human trait of laziness. But when (not if,
            when) a multi-national tech company with a bottomless pit of dollars buys into the concept and brings it all
            together, most likely behind a paywall (yes Microsoft, I’m looking at you with your $10 bn investment in
            CHAT GPT), things will certainly change. Time does not appear to be on our side.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it’s hardly surprising that there has been a rapidly growing anxiety about artificial intelligence and
            its impact on the future of content creation. People that make a living from their lexical skills fear that
            artificial intelligence will lead to a decrease in jobs associated with content creation and production
            created by humans. On the other hand, it is also true that some people believe that AI can provide many
            benefits to the process, such as improved access to more resources, improved data-driven insights and
            potentially faster output.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI is already being incorporated into content creation by providing automated solutions which help in
            creating, editing and visualising content. This technology can be used for activities such as data mining
            for identifying trends, content curation or the creation of visuals. AI can detect emerging developments in
            content to aid the creative process, from text analysis to video and audio editing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The capability of AI to create art has been seen in different forms, from digital music compositions to the
            visual arts. In many cases, AI-generated art has been able to fool a portion of the public thanks to a
            resemblance to real art created by humans, but this is now opening the doors to a complex process of
            litigation by originators who feel they are being plagiarised or pirated.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, for me, at present, although the fear of AI replacing traditional content production process is
            understandable, it is important to know that it is not always the best way forward. AI can be used as a
            complement or enhancement when creating content, but is not a replacement for the human element, which
            requires a subtle touch, nuance and a wealth of experience. AI might not know the difference between the
            words maize and corn, but a client in the cooking oil or popcorn business certainly will. AI is best used to
            automate parts of the process which can be tedious and time consuming, such as data collection and analysis,
            allowing the time saved to let us creators focus on the many imaginative and perhaps inspirational aspects
            of the content creation process.
          </p>
          <p>
            So for the time being, fear of AI and its use in content creation is natural, but it should not be a guiding
            factor when making decisions about the who/what/when/where/why and how of creating content. AI should be
            used to make the content creation process more efficient and allow more time for creativity, but should not
            be the final part of the process, which thankfully still requires intuitive human intervention. But make no
            mistake, there can be no doubt that AI and the machine-learning processes are going to get better, more
            impressive and more user-friendly in the future…
