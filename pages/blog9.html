            she felt in Viola’s wins across five separate categories, saying,
            “Our goal is always to strengthen and add
            value to every project we work on to maximize their impact and results. To be recognized by our peers for
            such a prestigious award among so many impressive submissions means a lot to us. The Eventex Awards 2023

            made up of a diverse group of talented people, has been honored with these awards for a project that was

            synergy were a driving force to make Abu Dhabi Moments a massive success.”

            pre-pandemic lifestyle, we are witnessing a remarkable surge in creativity and innovation, delivered by
            talented professionals who have wowed us with amazing event experiences. Winning an Eventex award is
            recognition for everyone in Viola Communications, so personally and on behalf of the whole Eventex team, I
            want to congratulate Viola on what is an absolutely outstanding achievement.”
