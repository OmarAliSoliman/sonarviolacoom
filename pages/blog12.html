          <p> In the 90s to early 2000s, there was no shortage of science fiction books and films that depicted the rise of A.I. and the end of humanity as we know it. As a sci-fi geek, I gobbled it all up from Terminator, Robocop, Bicentennial Man, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Her, and I, Robot. Through these ‘fin de siècle’ science fantasy works, both Hollywood and literature sensationalised the rise of A.I. and led us to think that sentient robots could eventually take over and rule the world. 


          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these dire depictions, what is obvious in 2023 is that A.I. will not violently replace humans overnight but it is here to stay and rather than fight against technological advancements, businesses are embracing tools that can supplement their workflow and improve dynamics in the workplace. However, there is a potential disaster in the making as while A.I. tools like OpenAI ChatGPT (and its variations) are powerful, there are no hard rules and regulations regarding their utilization set in place yet, therefore opening it to misuse if not utilised responsibly. Without checks and balances in the use of A.I., the list of things that could go wrong is worryingly endless. Instead of shunning the technology, we should welcome it on our own terms, because we can actually gain from it… the benefits have the potential to outweigh the risks. So far.

          </p>
          <p> Businesses, corporations and media organisations are beginning to incorporate A.I. tools into their work dynamics, not everyone has thought through how to maximise their potential. Instead of improving the content or information that they generate from ChatGPT, users often end up making their projects worse by merely copy/pasting or adding or deleting elements of the generated text thus ending up with a loss of context, flow and nuance – in other words, not making sense. “It’s like a word salad”, is what my line manager would (in fact does) say.

          </p>
          
          
          <p>
            <strong> So, here are some golden rules for using AI tools; but before we begin, let’s remember the most important point: AI is an aid, just like a dictionary, thesaurus or group-thinking session – it is not a replacement for nuance, subtlety or the human touch. The below relates to OpenAI/ChatGPT and all the different derivatives available at present.

            </strong>
             
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Lend a Helping Hand:
            </strong>
            As I mentioned before, agency life can be chaotic. No one wants to – or even needs to - struggle through a tough project on their own, so being able to offer support and help during difficult times is a simple way of showing your colleagues that you’re there to lend a hand if required. A shared experience can also lead to more meaningful connections, even if it’s just helping out with a minor task. 

          </p>

           
            <p>
                1.<strong> Critical thinking when utilising content generated by ChatGPT.</strong> It can enhance your work, provide inspiration and deliver thought-provoking content - but do not let it de-value your work through lazy copy/pasting of the answers it generates.

            </p>
          
            <p>
                2.	<strong>Always fact check and credit sources where possible. Just because ChatGPT says something</strong>, it does not mean it is necessarily always correct. Do your research, double-check and then double-check again. Always carry out due diligence by reading supporting materials or information to verify your work and sources.

            </p>
            <p>
                3.	<strong>Learn how to do more than just copy/paste content into a word document... Paraphrase, reword or rewrite your content.</strong> ChatGPT should only serve as a generator of a framework, guidelines or ideas for your content. It is better if you can reword, rephrase, or just take the cues and rewrite the entire content. Make it original, make it uniquely yours.

            </p>
           <p>
            4.	<strong>Use ChatGPT to enhance your work, not do it for you.</strong> While it may be tempting to let it do the work for you, make an effort to let ChatGPT provide supplemental content rather than relying on it 100% for a project that you are working on. Do not let it make you lazy and reliant on A.I., because we are creatives, not plagiarists.

           </p>
           <p>

5.	<strong>Make sure you ask the right prompt questions.</strong> One can fully maximise ChatGPT’s potential when you learn to ask the right questions. Be specific, concise and clear when you ask questions, and if you don’t get the answers you want, expand your prompts.

           </p>
           <p>
            6.	<strong>Ask a friend or colleague (or anyone with a second pair of eyes) to double check your work.</strong> Writers need a proof-reading pair of eyes to double check their work, so ask a friend or a colleague to double check yours. Sometimes what seems to make sense to you may not make sense to others. 

           </p>
           <p>
           7.	<strong>Humanise content, insert nuance and help it make sense.</strong> It is self-contradictory that in a world where we encourage the humanising of brands in communication strategies, some people seem quite happy to trust A.I. to generate content for us. The simple rule here is to always insert nuance in your content. Is it thought-provoking? Does it inspire? Does it stir the appropriate emotions? Does it resonate with my readers? Ask yourself these things before submitting any copy.
        </p>
        <p>
8.	<strong>Remember that AI-based research is not always right.</strong> ChatGPT generates its answers based on an aggregated knowledgebase from around the Internet. However, we know that not everything we find online is credible. Always bear in mind that not all content generated by an A.I. tool may be true (which is why we always double/triple check!).
</p>
<p>
9.	<strong>Insert creativity and do not rely 100% on A.I. Do not let A.I.</strong> stifle your creativity or your ability to think for yourself. Be creative and make sure that your creativity is reflected in the work you produce. It not only enhances output, but also humanises it, which makes it more relatable.
</p>
<p>
10.	<strong>Cite chat GPT as your source.</strong> This may be debatable but governments, businesses and other institutions are seeking ways to legislate the use of A.I. tools in the workplace and schools. In some places, set rules and regulations in institutions are already in place, such as the requirement to cite in your work where ChatGPT was utilised. It is only a matter of time until legislation on the use of A.I. tools is implemented, so as a responsible user, why not start now? 
</p>
<p>
    Make your work make sense, let your content (generated or otherwise, because the human creative can also make the above errors of judgement) connect with your target audience by stirring up emotions as you find the best way to get your message across. In a world where brand strategies require humanisation, it is perhaps counter-productive to use content written by a glorified chat-bot, albeit a rather sophisticated one. Yes, we have grown exponentially since the science-fiction trends of the last century, but all the personal, professional and technological development that comes with our digital evolution means nothing if we do not understand how to maintain the vital element of basic humanity in our work, do not lose the connections you work hard to establish with your audience. Use ChatGPT, but use it responsibly!
