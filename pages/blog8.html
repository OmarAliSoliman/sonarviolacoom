          <p>As the world gears up towards becoming more environmentally friendly, sustainability is the most used
            buzz-word that has become an addition to our daily vocabulary. When we think of sustainability, we think of
            reducing our carbon footprint, protecting the environment, saving paper and water, recycling, and generally
            being more conscious when it comes to the environment and our daily routines.
          </p>
          <p>
            But have you ever thought of how the events industry is impacted by sustainability?
          </p>
          <p>The events industry is one of the most dynamic and growing industries at the moment, but it is also one
            that generates huge amounts of waste on a yearly basis and has a massive impact on the environment. This is
            due to the fact that event setups are temporary, they have to be taken down eventually and so not only
            result in huge waste of materials, but also precious energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn’t have to be this way however, and in recent years a lot of steps have been taken to minimize this
            waste which has not only brought about less waste, but also cost cutting, more creativity, and improved
            brand images.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many ways that we can be sustainable in events:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>- Be conscious of the materials you choose:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past, most of the structures used in events were made of wood. This is because wood is the easiest
            material to use and source and is the most cost efficient. The problem with that is that when wood is used,
            it usually has to be covered with paint or graphics (which means more paper). The bigger problem is that all
            this material is usually discarded right after the event as it can no longer be used in any other way
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent years, companies have moved towards using different materials such as plastics and metal to be
            more minimalistic, reduce bulkiness, and create more aesthetically pleasing, and adventurous, designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem here is that we have moved towards materials that are not environmentally friendly. Wood remains
            the best option as it is both renewable and with forethought, recyclable, and so as an events company, we
            try as much as possible to suggest options where we can re-use and re-build this wood as many times as
            possible to make the most out of it, after which it can be discarded in an environmentally friendly way
            where it may be re-purposed, therefore reducing our carbon imprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> - Re-use structures </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This also helps both the company and the client save money, as we make efforts to re-use what we already
            have, therefore reducing both cost and waste.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recently adopted this model when delivering a series of events across a 2-month period. Instead of new
            structures for each event, we re-built the same set-up every time we moved from one event to the next,
            re-purposing the structures for different functions, which served to save money and preserve the event’s
            brand image, instilling the brand identity in people’s minds, proving that sustainability can be both
            efficient, and when used creatively, a great marketing strategy as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enhancing the brand image is a very important goal of any event or marketing campaign, and being sustainable
            helps do that. Not only does sustainability make a difference when we re-use structures, but promoting a
            brand as sustainably conscious helps enhance the brand’s reputation and promote the client as a socially
            responsible entity that has a commitment to both the environment and the consumer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>- Be conscious of the energy you use:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            When running an event, we need power, and running a temporary event usually needs backup generators that run
            on traditional fuels to generate energy. In order to be sustainable, we have seen a shift towards using
            renewable energy, such as solar power for lighting. It is inevitable however, that at some point, we will
            need to use fossil fuel to drive those generators, and in this case the best practice is to only use them
            when absolutely necessary, and to limit the use of power generated in this way to the event days itself,
            using temporary power during set-up days, solar power for lighting during overnight set-ups, and always
            monitoring fuel consumption to ensure there is minimal wastage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shift towards more sustainable events comes at a time where the world has become more environmentally
            conscious. People have realized the importance of protecting and preserving our home, and the events
            industry’s role in doing so is no different from the rest of the population. Together, we are working
            towards reducing our carbon footprint and achieving a more sustainable environment.
