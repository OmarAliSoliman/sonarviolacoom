                    <p>As the world moves into a post-COVID recovery mode, certain elements within the communications
                        industry have an important role to fulfil in the context of re-prioritising societal norms, a
                        responsibility to assist in building, or at least reinforcing, a culture of benevolence. It
                        seems almost oxymoronic to associate marketing with altruism, but, as was once famously said,
                        with great power comes great responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Lockdowns, curfews and social distancing have had an effect on communities around the world,
                        especially communities that have long-held traditions of hospitality and functions designed to
                        enhance the mutual wellbeing of society, like those of the Middle East and Arab nations.</p>
                    <p>Live events have always served a well-defined purpose in supporting the element of human
                        connection and companionship, and are now helping to engage and enthuse a population that has
                        undergone a fundamental change in how they interact with each other by the circumstances: by
                        designing events that are inclusive, welcoming and above all, fun, we can cross cultural
                        boundaries and build bonds that lead to a more involved, and happier, community. However,
                        without genuinely effective PR, those events could easily pass by unnoticed.</p>
                    <p>At Viola Communications, the PR and Events teams are inextricably intertwined in a symbiotic
                        relationship, complementing each other and playing a major role in community development through
                        the company's support for a range of government department policies, NGO initiatives and
                        business oriented CSR, each of which demands its own style of strategic thinking in order to
                        achieve both individual and group goals.</p>
                    <p>As in all areas of Viola's operations, there are as many differences in approach to PR as there
                        are diverse types of events, and each of these must be assessed according to a huge range of
                        factors. For example, a CSR event dedicated to benefitting both the client organization and the
                        community will require a strategy that reflects authenticity and a genuine desire to make a
                        difference within that community, whereas a government sponsored event, or series of events,
                        targeting community resilience should demonstrate a commitment to adhering to a set of
                        principles laid down as part of an official vision or mission for long-term benefits - not only
                        for current communities, but for generations to come.</p>
                    <p>One of our most valuable assets at Viola is the passion and devotion we put into every facet of
                        our work - whether it's organizing a family function at a remote community in the Al Dafrah
                        region of Abu Dhabi Emirate, or a global conference and seminar on world volunteering - every
                        team member across PR and Events will have played an active role in devising, creating and
                        following through on the event itself or the PR surrounding it: adding a little bit here,
                        editing a bit off there, until the desired objective is reached. Our multi-national and
                        multi-cultural teams are a microcosm of the world we are living in, and so have the flexibility
                        to understand, support and provide the means for our clients in social development to accomplish
                        their aims, while at the same time establishing effective CSR programs for private or
                        semi-private sector organizations in community engagement.</p>
                    <p>The PR and Events industries are not mutually exclusive - and they can both play their part in
                        developing social cohesion, helping to maintain both physical and mental health for all, which
                        is so important these days. The beauty of our day-to-day work is found in the results of our
                        collaborations, when we see the effect that our collective positivity has on our audience, both
                        client-side and in the communities themselves. Then we know that the spirit of community is
                        alive and well in the UAE, and we at Viola have helped plan, develop, put into practice (and
                        marketed) a culturally relevant event that has a meaningful impact on our society.</p>
