          <p>The UAE is home to some of the highest quality and densest array of outdoor advertising platforms in the
            world due to its economic strength and the high demand for outdoor media in the region. Out-of-home
            advertising is now surpassing the reach of traditional media, allowing companies to expand their visibility,
            build brand awareness, and engage their target customers in both the physical and digital environments.</p>
          <p>As a result of this redefined reach, clients are seeking a much greater understanding of OOH media, driven
            by this increase in demand, many initiatives are being rolled out by the UAE’s media agencies to advise
            their clients on the efficiencies and benefits of OOH.</p>
          <p>For many years, outdoor media was seen as a secondary and somewhat less effective form of advertising in
            comparison to more traditional media like print, radio and television. However, in recent years the strength
            of outdoor in the UAE has grown significantly, and based on a series of measurable parameters that relate
            specifically to the industry, we are finding that:</p>

          <ul class="listinarticle">
            <li>
              <p>Brands/marketers are shifting back to OOH to grow their brand metrics</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>OOH creative content is becoming more sophisticated given the recent technology advances of
                immersive, 3D, interactive, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Data and tech are playing a much more vital role in improving OOH efficiencies</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Data is now much simpler to analyse with digital metrics. Campaign impressions, reach and frequencies
                can be accurately measured.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Much of the industry is transforming from static formats into DOOH in many of their assets and
                digital screens are providing better optimizations leading to higher demand from marketers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The main Dubai & Abu Dhabi geographic landscapes encourage big formats, hence better visibility and
                impact</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>From these factors, we can confidently deduce that 2023 is going to be a very promising year for Viola
            Outdoor OOH.</p>
          <p>As the leading exclusive provider of OOH advertising media space in Abu Dhabi, we combine experience and
            in-depth knowledge of the UAE and global media markets and trends to constantly deliver cutting-edge OOH
            solutions, to continue to develop and bring innovation to our OOH media to create memorable experiences,
            engage audiences and enhance the overall media landscape with strategic distributions across the capital
            offering high visibility and exposure, precise, accurate and measurable results.</p>
          <p>2023 will see Viola Outdoor rolling-out its full digital transformation plan, one which has been driven in
            response to demand for digital reinvention, with more innovations in formats to meet brands’ planning
            objectives. Our most strategic and visible large format bridge banners are now transformed into digital
            top-of-the-line screens and as the roll-out progresses, more Viola Outdoor screens will bring a rise in the
            number of available impressions, which in turn will enable media buyers to move into a new optimization
            phase whereby the quality of screens is baked into the value equation alongside cost of their media plans.
          </p>
          <p>This year, the OOH market size is expected to experience 5-10% growth, according to Ipsos. And while online
            advertising will continue to follow an upward trajectory, the major growth is expected to take place in the
            DOOH domain. With the OOH total spend globally ranked in 3rd place after digital at #1 and TV at #2, media
            plans are now mostly 50-60% for digital and online budgets.</p>
          <p>So, with the new DOOH metrics offered, we are about to witness shifts in budgeting to digital media. In
            2023, digital outdoor media will increasingly become an integral part of a business’s advertising strategy.
            With increasing access to 5G technology and the ability to reach customers in unique ways, businesses will
            be able to target their customers more effectively and build a deeper connection with them.
