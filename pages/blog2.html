                    <p>It is noon, end of July. I am stuck in my house, working remotely on projects.
                        You will agree with me that it is not the ideal way of spending summer
                        holidays but I am sure that most of you have felt the same and can relate
                        to this. I know I am not the only one and that each one of us has his or
                        her battles to fight.</p>
                    <p>Well, it is what it is and we have to accept it! Not because we have no
                        other choice, but because acceptance is the start of the way to solve a
                        problem and find solutions that can work in either our business or life.</p>
                    <p>As I pause my work and think, I remember all these summers I used to spend
                        back home in the sea playing with the waves. The laughter and joy that
                        it brought was enormous as well as the smiles to my family, friends and
                        myself. As I dig deeper in my memories, I recall that we always calculated
                        how to go about riding a wave; it was done by either seeing our friends
                        or testing ourselves on the first wave before we ride the second. We always
                        watched and saw the waves direction, breaking point and speed.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays, when you hear the words “the second wave”, the first thing that
                        comes to your mind is another lockdown because of the pandemic and all
                        the negative connotations and consequences that this can bring. Well yes,
                        it may be true too, but we should not be negative and think all these,
                        because as I said earlier, the second wave could be a much better one,
                        a one that can improve performance at all levels now that everyone has
                        revaluated where he is, where he wants to go and what he wants to achieve.
                        The second wave can be that one that will either break you if you are not
                        careful, or make you rise in glory. Moreover, second as a place is always
                        good because you have something to look up to, a direction to follow, this
                        time with a more successful approach and technique.</p>
                    <p>So yes, we are ready for the second wave but we truly believe that this
                        will be the wave of success and good quality work that will bring value
                        to both our clients and our industry as a whole.</p>
