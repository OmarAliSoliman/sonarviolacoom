                    <h1>Supporting the nation through<br> philanthropic endeavours </h1>
                    <p>
                        Viola Communications is uniquely placed to be able to leverage its assets for the benefit of the
                        UAE’s society. This, for Viola Communications, is a moral imperative and has been most recently
                        seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, when we supported the nation at a difficult time with
                        positive messages of comfort, thanks and appreciation to medical front-line personnel, and
                        uplifting words of encouragement for the public.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is how we, as a people, ‘pay it forward’ – and this is how Viola Communications aligns
                        itself with the simple concept of contributing to philanthropic measures by actively supporting
                        ethical practices.

                    <h1>Committed to the nation</h1>
                    <p>
                        Every year, on the occasion of the UAE’s National Day, Viola Communications utilises its OOH
                        assets to decorate the city of Abu Dhabi with UAE themed patriotic artworks that reflect the
                        strength of pride in the nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this special day, and many other annual celebrations and commemorations, Viola engages with
                        public sentiment and contributes to the honouring of the country and its leadership.

                    <p>
                        As part of our CSR responsibilities, we are active every year during Breast Cancer Awareness
                        month, encouraging the general public to go and get checked, to find out more, and to discover
                        how they can help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this way, Viola remains aligned with a global awareness campaign to motivate women and men to
                        help spread awareness and understanding about the importance of early check-ups.
